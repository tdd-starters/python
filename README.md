# Python TDD Starter
Starter project for getting started with TDD in Python. Based on [https://github.com/raniz85/python-template].

The file _tests/test_calculator.py contains one test case and a few in comments. Start by coming
up with a few test cases and add them to the lists, then implement them one at a time, test-driving the
solution forwards.

## Libraries
Refer to [the template](https://github.com/Raniz85/python-template#technologies) for more information about what
the starter contains.

## Running
There's a makefile that can be used to run all the tests. Execute:

```shell
$ make test
```

to run all the tests.
